# Computational-Microbiome-Analysis-Workshop
Project Description
A comprehensive machine learning pipeline. The project centered on network propagation to analyze microbiome and metabolome data for disease classification. It integrates CLR transformation, adaptive variance filtering, correlation-based reduction, hierarchical clustering, and multi-layer Random Forests. Includes cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, threshold adjustment, and AUPR optimization. implements a novel approach for feature selection.
